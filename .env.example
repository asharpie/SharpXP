# Base URL for externally-hosted media files (videos, music, images).
# Leave empty or omit for local development (files served from public/).
# In production, set this to your CDN / cloud storage URL.
#
# Examples:
#   VITE_MEDIA_BASE_URL=https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
#   VITE_MEDIA_BASE_URL=https://cdn.example.com
#   VITE_MEDIA_BASE_URL=https://your-project.r2.dev
#
# The URL should NOT have a trailing slash.
# Your bucket/CDN should mirror the public/ folder structure:
#   <base>/images/...
#   <base>/videos/...
#   <base>/music/...
